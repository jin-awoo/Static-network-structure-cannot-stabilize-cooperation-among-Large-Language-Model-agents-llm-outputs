If you choose to cooperate (represented by 'C'), you pay 10 points for each player you are connected to and each of them gain 60 points. If you choose to defect (represented by 'D'), you do not pay any points and do not change the points of the players you are connected to. Each player you are connected to has the same choice. For each of them that chooses 'C', you gain 60 points. Once everyone makes a decision, I will tell you the result of the round. You will be shown the choices of each player you are connected to and how many points in total you gained or lost. You will also be shown how many points each player you are connected to gained or lost in total. These numbers are affected by your choice, their choice, and also the choices of any other players connected by them who may or may not be connected to you.
